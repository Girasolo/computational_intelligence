## Evolution vs Genetic Algorithm
We decided to try both ways to solve for the problem, we went more in depth with the evolution aspect, but we kept the genetic algorithm to keep things interesting.

## Evolutionary Approach: Benchmarking
We developed some strategies to benchmark our more advanced strategies, this usually includes lots of randomness, but some have a little logic to improve the finishing moves for example.
- randomNim: Random row, random number of elements
- gabrielleNim: Pick always the maximum possible number of the lowest row
- randomAllNim: Random row, but pick the maximum number of elements
- longestAllNim: Pick always the longest row
- randomSmartNim: Here the strategy improves on the pure random, where it improves the last move

## Evolutionary Approach: 2-parameters
This is the main topic of the lab assignment, the strategies designed to evolve when competing against the benchmarks. These are strategies that use 2 parameters to evolve, for simplicity they are called "p1" and "p2", but different strategies use this two differently.
- E2longestVSshortest_allVS1smart: Shortest row vs Longest Row and pick one element vs take the maximum number of elements
- E2randomVSshortest_allVS1smart: Random row vs Shortest Row and pick one elements vs take the maximum number of elements
- E2longestVSshortest_allVS1allsmart: Shortest row vs Longest Row and a complex selection of whether to take one element or a subset
- E2longestVSrandom_allVS1allsmart: Random row vs Longest Row and a complex selection of whether to take one element or a subset
- E2shortestVSrandom_allVS1allsmart: Random row vs Shortest Row and a complex selection of whether to take one element or a subset
- EsafetySmart: Safety strategy creates based on p1 "safety" nets to fall back on, as the game progresses. The idea is that creating rows with 2 elements can help this strategy win against more complex benchmarks as it uses the safety nets created at the beginning of the game to outsmart the opponent towards the end of the match

## Genetic Approach: Strategy
E3shortestVSlongest_percentage is the only strategy that uses the genetic approach with 3 paraments. Each parament is a chance of take the shortest or longest and how many elements in the row to pick.

## Genetic Approach: Initial Population
In the population individual are represented as a tuple which contains the value of the fitness of the individual, a mask of booleans which represents whether a list is part of the individual and a label that describes the tweak type (mutation, crossover or initial).
We randomly selected a viable individuals of the size of the population that we wanted, the viability is based on capability of an individual to provide a possible solution to the problem (with suboptimal fitness values). 

## Genetic Approach: Fitness Metric
Our fitness metric is based on reaped test (function evaluate) against a different strategy, usually a random strategy with a few tweaks to improve it.

## Genetic Approach: Mutation
The parent on which we apply the genetic operator are chosen with a tournament selection which basically consists in selecting two individuals randomly and selecting who has the best fitness.
Moreover we apply a random gaussian noise to the paramenters of the parent and add it to the offspring list.
